# Mona Lisaâ€™s Genetic Makeover

## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of a genetic algorithm to recreate an image using polygons and uses a parallel genetic algorithm for optimization.

## Approach

Based on the [paper](https://medium.com/@sebastian.charmot/genetic-algorithm-for-image-recreation-4ca546454aaa) by Sebastian Charmot.

The algorithm is based on the following steps:

1. Generate a random population of polygons
2. Compute the fitness of each individual
3. Select the best individual
4. Apply crossover between the best individual and the population (with stocking the previous best individual)
5. Apply mutation to the population (except the previous best individual), which consists in adding a random polygon to all individuals
6. Repeat from step 2, x times to upgrade the image
